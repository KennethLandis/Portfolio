            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="wrapper">Learning new skills has always been a passion of mine, whether it's learning chess openings, memorizing base designs on Rust, or finding optimal tile sets for Settlers of Catan.<br>
                <br>
            After high school I attended two years of college and found myself lost on where to continue. Over the next 12 year I experienced different industries and workplaces attempting to find something to be passionate about.  Web-development stood out as a career that provided the daily challenges my mind craved, as well as a meritocracy that rewards hardwork and quality product development<br>
            <br>
            After spending roughly 400 development hours familiarizing myself with a few languages and the logic of coding, I enrolled at Bloc/Thinkful to immerse myself in a journey toward software development as my new career!<br>
            If you're looking for a new developer that is excited to tackle problems and build meaningful solutions toward future endeavours, please reach out! I'm excited to join a motivated team to build software that paves the way toward your goals.
